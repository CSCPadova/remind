# REMIND

## Description

This repository contains an Android application that simulates a magnetophone, specifically the Studer A810.

## Installation

**Windows** (tested, Windows 10, August 2018) **Linux** (tested, Arch Linux, September 2018 ) & **Mac** (not tested)

Install Android Studio: <https://developer.android.com/studio/>

Install Git: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Run Android Studio and import the project using Git. To do that go to `Check out project from Version Control` and select `Git`.

The URL is <https://gitlab.dei.unipd.it/AccessKit/remind-app-2018.git>, select the desired path, insert the required GitLab credentials and then click `Clone`.

Open the project and let Android Studio configure the environment.

## Usage

You will need:

*   SDK Platforms with the API 28

*   Android SDK Build-Tools

*   LLDB    (optional)

*   Android Emulator (optional)

*   Android SDK Platforms-Tools 28

*   Android SDK Tools 26.1.1

*   NDK

The installation and configuration of all these components can be done through Android Studio in `Tools->SDK Manager` or with the packet manager of your distribution (like `apt`, `pacman` and `aurman` if you are using Linux).

After cloning the repository and some Android Studio automatic config the application may not be configured to start. To solve this go in `File->Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

`Tools->AVD Manager->Create Virtual Device...` is usefull for the Android Emulator.

The application can be installed using the APK file in folder `Application APK`, simply copy the .apk on the device and launch it, it will install the app.

A lot actually.

## Notes

To copy files in the Android Emulator or in the real devices you can use the `adb` tool (with `adb push` and `adb pull` commands) or the Device File Explorer in Android Studio.

The folder that will contain the file that the app can use is `/storage/self/primary`.
